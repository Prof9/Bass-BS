BassBS
======
Giver336 thought BassGS was a little too easy, so we made him harder. And then it just kind of snowballed from there. Sorry for the mess.

This battle was made for the Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue Let's Play on Something Awful, which you can find [here](http://lparchive.org/Mega-Man-Battle-Network-3-Blue/Update%2066/). You can watch a video of the fight [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxlI_3xkSK4), but I would recommend going in blind first.

Check the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Prof9/bass-bs/releases) for the IPS patch. Apply it to a North American version Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue ROM, then go to Yoka and find Tamako outside the Ura Inn. The MetalManβ will have been replaced by the BassBS fight.

NOTE: This patch was made exclusively for the BassBS fight, so no care was taken in preserving any other enemies or fights. As such, there might be some side effects if you fight anything other than BassBS.
